Through Swift, we explore the basics of programming and introduce fundamental computer science topics like abstraction, algorithms, basic data structures, and recursion. The course also features practical programming topics such as scripting, command line interfaces, application programming interfaces, debugging, integrated development environments, understanding documentation, and developing software both in isolation and as a team. By the end, each student designs and implements an app that can be deployed to iOS devices, like an iPhone or an iPad. Students must bring a MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro running Mac OS10.11 or higher.\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nThis course is held during Session I of the 2016 Harvard Pre-College Program which runs from Monday, 27 June through Friday, 8 July. Class is held Monday through Friday from 8:30am to 11:30am in [1 Story Street room 304](https://goo.gl/maps/bVi9HwpQVRt). \r\n\r\n## Office Hours\r\nOffice Hours to be announced the first day of class.\r\n\r\n### Day 0\r\nAbstraction, algorithms, pseudocode, source code, compilation and interpretation. Swift basics: variables, boolean expressions, logical operators, arithmetic, and control flow.\r\n\r\n#### Homework Due\r\n1. Install OS X 10.11.5 and Xcode 7.3.1 for class\r\n1. [Fill out pre-survey](http://bit.ly/swift-presurvey)\r\n1. [Sign up for a **free** Apple Developer Account (do not sign up for the $100 account!)](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/)\r\n\r\n### Day 1\r\nTheory of computation, programming paradigms. More Swift topics including data types, arrays, and functions.\r\n\r\n### Day 2\r\nAlgorithmic complexity, parallelism, version control. More Swift topics including data types, arrays, and functions.\r\n* _Eliot:_ Loops, exercise review, how to approach looping problems.\r\n* _Kirkland:_ Version control and Git.\r\n\r\n### Day 3\r\nFunctions, dictionaries, closures, lambda. Possibly: defining new operators and higher-order functions.\r\n\r\n### Day 4\r\nBinary, ASCII, basic encryption, iOS.\r\n\r\n### Day 5\r\nGame of Fifteen, Xcode, iOS application lifecycle.\r\n\r\n### Day 6\r\nMore details on Storyboard elements, including constraints. Programmatically creating UI elements.\r\n\r\n### Day 7\r\nBounds and frames of UI elements, animating UI element properties, timers, debugging (via breakpoints and print statements), more on approaching the Game of Fifteen app.\r\n\r\n### Day 8\r\nUI alerts with one and two buttons, action sheets with multiple buttons. Alternative approaches to the Game of Fifteen implementation.\r\n\r\n### Day 9\r\nWrap-up. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Staff\r\n![Dan](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18ab7e51859c303fd34aae011de9f326?s=200&d=retro)|&nbsp;|&nbsp;\r\n----|----|----\r\n**Dan Armendariz**|**TBA**|**TBA**\r\nInstructor|Teaching Fellow|Teaching Fellow\r\n[Email](mailto:danallan@cs.harvard.edu)||\r\n[Web](http://www.danallan.net), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/danallan)||",
