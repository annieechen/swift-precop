Through Swift, we explore the basics of programming and introduce fundamental computer science topics like abstraction, algorithms, basic data structures, and recursion. The course also features practical programming topics such as scripting, command line interfaces, application programming interfaces, debugging, integrated development environments, understanding documentation, and developing software both in isolation and as a team. By the end, each student designs and implements an app that can be deployed to iOS devices, like an iPhone or an iPad. Students must bring a MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro running Mac OS10.11 or higher.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility\r\n\r\nThe Summer School is committed to providing an accessible academic community. The [Accessibility Services Office](http://summer.harvard.edu/campus-life/accessibility-student-services) offers a variety of accommodations and services to students with documented disabilities.\r\n\r\n## Academic Integrity\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for understanding [Harvard Summer School policies on academic integrity](http://summer.harvard.edu/policies/student-responsibilities) and how to use sources responsibly. Please be sure to read through the responsibilities, as not knowing the rules or misunderstanding the rules are not acceptable excuses. Please contact the staff if you have any questions about academic honesty.\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nThis course is held during Session I of the 2016 Harvard Pre-College Program which runs from Monday, 27 June through Friday, 8 July.
