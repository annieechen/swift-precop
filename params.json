{"name":"iOS App Development: Swift","tagline":"Harvard Pre-College Program, Session II","body":"This course is an introduction to programming using Swift, Apple's new programming language for Macs and iOS devices. Through Swift, we explore the basics of programming and introduce fundamental computer science topics like abstraction, algorithms, basic data structures, and recursion. The course also features practical programming topics such as scripting, command line interfaces, application programming interfaces, debugging, integrated development environments, understanding documentation, and developing software both in isolation and as a team. By the end, each student designs and implements an app that can be deployed to iOS devices, like an iPhone or an iPad. Students must bring a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro running Mac OS10.10 or higher. You may also wish to bring an iOS device running iOS 7 or later to run your apps, but this is not required. No prior programming experience is assumed.\r\n\r\n### Classes\r\nDay|Topics|Homework due\r\n---|------|------------\r\nMonday||Install OS X 10.10.4 and Xcode 6.4 for class\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\n\r\nClass is held Monday through Friday from 8:30am to 11:30am in [Pierce Hall 301](https://map.cs50.net/435).\r\n\r\n### Staff\r\n\r\n![Dan](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18ab7e51859c303fd34aae011de9f326?s=200&d=retro)|![Cheng](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0176d3b0acb07b071a01a425fc189909?s=200&d=retro)|![Dino](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6898642ee7291b6fa52f43768358b4d3?s=200&d=retro)\r\n----|----|----\r\n**Dan Armendariz**|**Cheng Gong**|**Dino Rodriguez**\r\nInstructor|Teaching Fellow|Teaching Fellow\r\n[Website](www.danallan.net)||\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
