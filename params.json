{"name":"iOS App Development with Swift","tagline":"Harvard Pre-College Program CSCI P-14600, Session II","body":"**Jump to:** [Day 0](#day-0)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis course is an introduction to programming using Swift, Apple's new programming language for Macs and iOS devices. Through Swift, we explore the basics of programming and introduce fundamental computer science topics like abstraction, algorithms, basic data structures, and recursion. The course also features practical programming topics such as scripting, command line interfaces, application programming interfaces, debugging, integrated development environments, understanding documentation, and developing software both in isolation and as a team. By the end, each student designs and implements an app that can be deployed to iOS devices, like an iPhone or an iPad. Students must bring a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro running Mac OS10.10 or higher. You may also wish to bring an iOS device running iOS 7 or later to run your apps, but this is not required. No prior programming experience is assumed.\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nThis course is held during Session II of the 2015 Harvard Pre-College Program which runs from Monday, 13 July through Friday, 24 July. Class is held Monday through Friday from 8:30am to 11:30am in [Pierce Hall 301](https://map.cs50.net/435). \r\n\r\n### Day 0\r\n_Monday, 13 July._ Abstraction, algorithms, pseudocode, source code, compilation and interpretation. Basics of imperative programming with a [block language](http://snap.berkeley.edu/) including: statements, types, loops, boolean expressions, conditions, functions, arrays. Swift basics.\r\n\r\n#### Homework Due\r\n1. Install OS X 10.10.4 and Xcode 6.4 for class\r\n1. [Fill out pre-survey](http://bit.ly/swift-presurvey)\r\n1. [Sign up for a **free** Apple Developer Account (do not sign up for the $100 account!)](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/)\r\n\r\n#### Exercises for tomorrow\r\nBegin with number 1, and work your way down. Complete at least 2 by class time tomorrow!\r\n\r\n- _Temperature conversion._ Create a new playground and save it as \"Celsius\". In this playground, write a few lines of code that converts a variable containing some degrees in Fahrenheit, called `f`, to Celsius. And then implement the reverse, to convert back! Be sure to test your code. Below is a code fragment to get you started.\r\n```swift\r\n// YOUR NAME HERE\r\n// you@email.com\r\n//\r\n// Fahrenheit converter\r\n    \r\nvar f = 32\r\nlet Celsius = // your code here, using the `f` variable\r\n\r\nvar c = 10\r\nlet Fahrenheit = // your reverse code here\r\n```\r\n\r\n- _Diamonds._ In a new playground called \"Diamond\", generate a Diamond using Swift as shown below. Don't forget to open the console by clicking the **View** > **Assistant Editor** > **Show Assistant Editor**.\r\n![diamond](images/diamond.png)\r\n\r\nThe input should be the number of lines. To get you started, begin with this:\r\n```swift\r\n// YOUR NAME HERE\r\n// you@email.com\r\n//\r\n// Diamonds!\r\n\r\nlet NUM_LINES = 11\r\n\r\n// for loops here \r\n```\r\n\r\nBe sure to pay close attention to how many stars are on each line. Use `for` loops to create this design! You might first try creating pyramid shapes to get started:\r\n![pyramid](images/pyramid.png)\r\n\r\nHint: you may need to use both the `print()` function (which prints out a string *without* going to a newline) and the `println()` function (which prints out a string and then prints a newline). \r\n\r\n- _Credit card verification._ If you want to ramp up the challenge, attempt the following (only in the \"Bad Credit\" section) but in Swift, rather than C!\r\n[Bad Credit](https://cdn.cs50.net/2015/spring/psets/1/hacker1/hacker1.html#bad_credit)\r\n\r\n_Note:_ Swift doesn't (easily) allow for input from standard in, so don't use the `GetLongLong` function (which doesn't exist anyway). Instead, just input it as a string like so:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet card = 378282246310005\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Staff\r\n![Dan](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18ab7e51859c303fd34aae011de9f326?s=200&d=retro)|![Cheng](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0176d3b0acb07b071a01a425fc189909?s=200&d=retro)|![Dino](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6898642ee7291b6fa52f43768358b4d3?s=200&d=retro)\r\n----|----|----\r\n**Dan Armendariz**|**Cheng Gong**|**Dino Rodriguez**\r\nInstructor|Teaching Fellow|Teaching Fellow\r\n[Email](mailto:danallan@cs.harvard.edu)|[Email](mailto:cheng@cs50.harvard.edu)|[Email](mailto:dinorodriguez@college.harvard.edu)\r\n[Web](http://www.danallan.net), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/danallan)||","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
