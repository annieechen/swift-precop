 * Bubble sort

To understand Bubble sort, first watch this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kp-8OGwphY

You might also use this tool to help visualize the sort:
https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html
Select "Bubble sort", and compare it against others if you want!

If you did compare other sorts, you might realize that Bubble sort isn't the most efficient way to sort a list. However, it is one of the easiest to reason about and so it is a good sort to implement first.

Try to implement it below. We have provided some skeleton code to get you started. Be sure to complete all the "TODO"s!

let nums = [8, 2, 10, 9, 11, 1, 7, 3, 4]

func bubbleSort(var list: [Int]) -> [Int]
{
    for i in 0 ..< /* TODO */
    {
        for j in 0 ..< /* TODO */
        {
            if (/* TODO */)
            {
                /* TODO */
            }
        }
    }
    return list
}

// Here are some test cases
bubbleSort([1])
bubbleSort([5, 3])
bubbleSort([1, 2])
bubbleSort([-42, 0, 12, 6, -5])
bubbleSort([8, 2, 10 , 9, 11, 1, 7, 3, 4])
bubbleSort([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])

/* TODO: write more test cases */
